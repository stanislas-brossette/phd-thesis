\subsection{Understanding the environment through a point-cloud}
Segmentation pipeline:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Acquisition
  \item Filtering
  \item Region growing segmentation
  \item Planar Extraction
  \item Planar projection and Hull convex generation
  \item Re-orientation and transfer to the planner
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contact generation with convex surface inclusions}
Usual methods for generating surface contact are based on point-to-point sampling, on rectangular inclusion, or other limiting methods. We proposed to extend that to the inclusion of convex surfaces.

\subsection{Simulated scenarios planned on real-environment}
We present 2 planned scenarios with the HRP-2 robot
