\paragraph {Chapter 3: Some extensions of posture generation}
\subparagraph{Integration on Non-Inclusive Contacts in Posture Generation}

The method presented before is limiting in many cases. Ladder, stairs climbing\dots.
Sometimes it is not possible to ensure inclusion of 2 surfaces.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Contact geometry formulation
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Discretisation of contact surfaces for practical reasons
      \item Contact generation with convex surface inclusions
Usual methods for generating surface contact are based on point-to-point sampling, on rectangular inclusion, or other limiting methods. We extend that to the inclusion of convex surfaces.
      \item Inclusive contacts are no problem
      \item Non-Inclusive contacts lead to non-constant number of constraints or non-smooth gradients, cannot be solved with usual solvers with that formulation
    \end{itemize}
  \item{Non inclusive contact constraints}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item {Main Idea: Inserting an ellipse in the intersection of polygons}
      \item {Pseudo-distance(to simplify the formulation)}
      \item {Modification of the optimization problem}
      \item {Maximization of the contact area}
      \item {Using non inclusive contact to maintain stability}
      \item {Extension to singular cases}
    \end{itemize}
  \item{Simulation Results}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Inclined ladder climbing}
      \item{Vertical ladder climbing}
      \item{Climbing Stairs}

\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{On the use of lifted variables for Robotics Posture Generation}

  \item {Introduction: "J. Albersmeyer and M. Diehl, The lifted Newton Method and its Application in Optimisation"}

    \item Never managed to get results faster than basic methods
  \end{itemize}
  \item{Motivation:Development of a posture generator with a specialized solver}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Problem
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Robotics problems solved with generic solvers (IPOPT, CFSQP, fmincon...)
          \item Robotics problems(especially posture generation) are very specific (Constraints, costs, working spaces, sizes...)
        \end{itemize}
      \item Solution
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Develop a posture generator, along with a non-linear solver
          \item Better understanding of our own solver
          \item Ability to use the solver in new ways:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Working on Manifolds
            \item Variable numbers of constraints
            \item Automatic management of variables, constraints and mathematical expressions
