		  developing a new generation of virtual human models that
		  are highly realistic in appearance, movement, and feedback.
		  Santos�, an anatomically correct human model with more
		  than 100 degrees of freedom, is an avatar that exhibits
		  extensive modelling and simulation capabilities, resides in
		  a virtual environment, and conducts human-factors analysis.
		  The paper presents an optimisation-based approach to
		  posture and motion prediction that allows the avatar to
		  operate with autonomy rather than depending on stored
		  animations and data or being restricted by inverse
		  kinematics. It also presents approaches to determining
		  reach envelopes and workspace zone differentiation, and
		  discusses methods for evaluating the physiological status
		  of the virtual human as it completes tasks. Muscle
		  modelling including muscle wrapping, muscle force and
		  stress determination is also discussed. Finally, the
		  process of building a 25-DOF hand model is described. The
		  result is an exciting step towards a virtual human that is
		  more extensive and complete than any other.},

  year		= {2008},
  abstract	= {Many problems in the sciences and engineering can be
		  rephrased as optimization problems on matrix search spaces
		  endowed with a so-called manifold structure. This book
		  shows how to exploit the special structure of such problems
		  to develop efficient numerical algorithms. It places
		  careful emphasis on both the numerical formulation of the
		  algorithm and its differential geometric
		  abstraction-illustrating how good algorithms draw equally
		  from the insights of differential geometry, optimization,
		  and numerical analysis. Two more theoretical chapters
		  provide readers with the background in differential
		  geometry necessary to algorithmic development. In the other
		  chapters, several well-known optimization methods such as
		  steepest descent and conjugate gradients are generalized to
		  abstract manifolds. The book provides a generic development
		  of each of these methods, building upon the material of the
		  geometric chapters. It then guides readers through the
		  calculations that turn these geometrically formulated
		  methods into concrete numerical algorithms. The
		  state-of-the-art algorithms given as examples are
		  competitive with the best existing algorithms for a
		  selection of eigenspace problems in numerical linear
		  algebra. Optimization Algorithms on Matrix Manifolds offers
		  techniques with broad applications in linear algebra,
		  signal processing, data mining, computer vision, and
		  statistical analysis. It can serve as a graduate-level
		  textbook and will be of interest to applied mathematicians,
		  engineers, and computer scientists.},

		  polyarticulated robotic system for which support contacts
		  are allowed to occur between any part of the body and any
		  part of the environment. Starting with a description of the
		  environment and of a target, it computes a sequence of
		  postures that allow our system to reach its target. We
		  describe a very generic architecture of this planner,
		  highly modular, as well as a first implementation of it. We
		  then present our results, both simulations and real
		  experiments, for a simple grasping task using the HRP-2
		  humanoid robot.},

		  for humanoid robots in an unknown environment. We present
		  an efficient combination of on-line 3D environment modeling
		  and motion planning methods for humanoid robots (e.g whole
		  body motion and walking ) in non-static environment. To
		  construct the model of the environment, we rely on 3D
		  occupancy grid that is updated incrementally by stereo
		  vision. As the dimension of configuration space is high for
		  humanoid robots, a roadmap based method is used for motion
		  planning. However, as the environment is not static, it is
		  necessary to update the roadmap after receiving new visual
		  information. In other words, the nodes and edges which are
		  in collision, based on the new update of the environment,
		  must be erased. Moreover, preliminary steps are necessary
		  for considering the environment as a non-static model. As
		  we construct the model incrementally by vision, several
		  thousands points would appear in each update of the model.
		  Therefore, updating the roadmap raises algorithmic
		  complexity issues. Our approach is an extension of a recent
		  idea to cope with the problem. After presenting the
		  approach, we implement our method by planning a
		  collision-free motion in a 3D occupancy grid model
		  generated by HRP2 based on stereo vision. As the robot
		  navigates in the environment, it receives updated
		  information through its on-board cameras and refreshes the
		  3D model of the environment incrementally. Conventionally,
		  the 3D model can be composed of up to millions of voxel. If
		  the statuses of some voxels change, our method uses these
		  changes to update the last roadmap locally. This updated
		  roadmap is then reused for further motion planning. We
		  evaluate our algorithm by measuring processing time and
		  memory usage in each step and compare them with its
		  descendant.},

		  In this paper, we propose a practical and real-time self

		  Previous researches usually add a safety margin around each
		  link to cope with errors in both modeling and control.
		  However this margin significantly decreases a range of
		  movement of a joint, especially a compound joint, a joint
		  between adjacent links and composed of 2 or 3 revolute
		  joints whose axis intersect in a same point In order to
		  gain enough a range of movement and safety margin, we
		  developed hybrid approach that uses both table based
		  collision checking for compound joints and online
		  geometrical model checking with a simplified link shape for
		  other joints We have experimentally evaluated our self

		  introduce a robust technique for directly parametrizing a
		  genus-zero$\backslash$nsurface onto a spherical domain. A
		  key ingredient for making such$\backslash$na
		  parametrization practical is the minimization of a
		  stretch-based$\backslash$nmeasure, to reduce
		  scale-distortion and thereby prevent
		  undersampling.$\backslash$nOur second contribution is a
		  scheme for sampling the spherical domain$\backslash$nusing
		  uniformly subdivided polyhedral domains, namely the
		  tetrahedron,$\backslash$noctahedron, and cube. We show that
		  these particular semiregular samplings$\backslash$ncan be
		  conveniently represented as completely regular 2D grids,
		  i.e.$\backslash$ngeometry images. Moreover, these images
		  have simple boundary extension$\backslash$nrules that aid
		  many processing operations. Applications include
		  geometry$\backslash$nremeshing, level-of-detail, and
		  morphing, compression, and smooth$\backslash$nsurface subdivision.},

		  decomposes the point cloud into a concise, hybrid structure
		  of inherent shapes and a set of remaining points. Each
		  detected shape serves as a proxy for a set of corresponding
		  points. Our method is based on random sampling and detects
		  planes, spheres, cylinders, cones and tori. For models with
		  surfaces composed of these basic shapes only, e.g. CAD
		  models, we automatically obtain a representation solely
		  consisting of shape proxies. We demonstrate that the
		  algorithm is robust even in the presence of many outliers
		  and a high degree of noise. The proposed method scales well
		  with respect to the size of the input point cloud and the
		  number and size of the shapes within the data. Even point
		  sets with several millions of samples are robustly
		  decomposed within less than a minute. Moreover the
		  algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement.

		  the distance function and its derivatives. As the theory is
		  not too complicated, the algorithm is very easy to

		  the circle-circle distance algorithm for the circle-line
		  distance calculation. Results of computational simulation
		  compared with Eberly's Wild Magic library are given and
		  summarized in detail at the end of the paper. They show
		  that the proposed algorithm always correctly finds the
		  global minimum with much higher accuracy at the same speed
		  in the circle-circle distance calculation case, whereas
		  circle-line calculation is approximately four times faster.
