  author	= {Absil, P.-A. and Mahony, R. and Sepulchre, R.},
  publisher	= {Princeton University Press},
  year		= {2008},
  abstract	= {Many problems in the sciences and engineering can be
		  rephrased as optimization problems on matrix search spaces
		  endowed with a so-called manifold structure. This book
		  shows how to exploit the special structure of such problems
		  to develop efficient numerical algorithms. It places
		  careful emphasis on both the numerical formulation of the
		  algorithm and its differential geometric
		  abstraction-illustrating how good algorithms draw equally
		  from the insights of differential geometry, optimization,
		  and numerical analysis. Two more theoretical chapters
		  provide readers with the background in differential
		  geometry necessary to algorithmic development. In the other
		  chapters, several well-known optimization methods such as
		  steepest descent and conjugate gradients are generalized to
		  abstract manifolds. The book provides a generic development
		  of each of these methods, building upon the material of the
		  geometric chapters. It then guides readers through the
		  calculations that turn these geometrically formulated
		  methods into concrete numerical algorithms. The
		  state-of-the-art algorithms given as examples are
		  competitive with the best existing algorithms for a
		  selection of eigenspace problems in numerical linear
		  algebra. Optimization Algorithms on Matrix Manifolds offers
		  techniques with broad applications in linear algebra,
		  signal processing, data mining, computer vision, and
		  statistical analysis. It can serve as a graduate-level
		  textbook and will be of interest to applied mathematicians,
		  engineers, and computer scientists.},

		  is an essentially important function for developing sensor
		  based behaviors without worrying about breaking hardware.
		  In this paper, we propose a practical and real-time self
		  collision detection system for humanoid robots that satisfy
		  both enough a range of movement and a safety margin.
		  Previous researches usually add a safety margin around each
		  link to cope with errors in both modeling and control.
		  However this margin significantly decreases a range of
		  movement of a joint, especially a compound joint, a joint
		  between adjacent links and composed of 2 or 3 revolute
		  joints whose axis intersect in a same point In order to
		  gain enough a range of movement and safety margin, we
		  developed hybrid approach that uses both table based
		  collision checking for compound joints and online
		  geometrical model checking with a simplified link shape for
		  other joints We have experimentally evaluated our self
		  collision detection system using a HRP2-JSK humanoid robot.
		  Our demonstration shows that the robot automatically stops
		  its motion when self collision occurs.},

		  In this paper, we propose a practical and real-time self

		  developed hybrid approach that uses both table based

		  each of the f i (x) are nonsmooth and non-convex, and in
		  particular present a method to determine critical points of

		  motion planning among obstacles. Like CHOMP (Covariant
		  Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning), our
		  algorithm can be used to find collision-free trajectories
		  from naive, straight-line initializations that might be in
		  collision. At the core of our approach are (a) a sequential
		  convex optimization procedure, which penalizes collisions
		  with a hinge loss and increases the penalty coefficients in
		  an outer loop as necessary, and (b) an efficient
		  formulation of the no-collisions constraint that directly
		  considers continuous-time safety Our algorithm is
		  implemented in a software package called TrajOpt. We report
		  results from a series of experiments comparing TrajOpt with
		  CHOMP and randomized planners from OMPL, with regard to
		  planning time and path quality. We consider motion planning
		  for 7 DOF robot arms, 18 DOF full-body robots, statically
		  stable walking motion for the 34 DOF Atlas humanoid robot,
		  and physical experiments with the 18 DOF PR2. We also apply
		  TrajOpt to plan curvature-constrained steerable needle
		  trajectories in the SE(3) configuration space and multiple
		  non-intersecting curved channels within 3D-printed implants
		  for intracavitary brachytherapy. Details, videos, and
